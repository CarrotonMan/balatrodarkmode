# How To Use

To use Balatro Dark Mode, you need to have [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk) installed. The pack contains two subpacks, a **Malverk** pack which contains the bulk of the textures and an **Extras** pack which contains small bits that are not supported by *Malverk*.

# FAQ

What does the **Extras** pack contain? Do I need to use it?
 - This pack is an optional addition that adds extra content that is not supported directly in malverk including:
   - Custom suit colors and corrected text (The suit jokers in the malverk pack already have these custom colors)
   - A custom darker green background in game
   - A dark main menu logo
